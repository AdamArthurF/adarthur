> A [majestic monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/) application built using AdonisJS

The repo contains the source code for a demo application built using AdonisJS. Since, AdonisJS is a fully featured, it contains everything you need to develop and deploy this application.

The application is architectured as a [majestic monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/) and contains all the source from database to design. 

- It uses [AdonisJS](http://adonisjs.com/) as a backend framework to manage the routing, database and the templates layer.
- It uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for design.
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for small interactive frontend widgets.
- And [hotwire turbo drive](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) for sleek page navigation.

The codebase serves two main purposes.

- One is to showcase the functionality and elegance of AdonisJS as a backend framework.
- Other is the simplicity of monolith architecture. I created this app in 3 days (working part time) with a pre-built Figma design.
